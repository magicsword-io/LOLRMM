Welcome to LOLRMM (Living Off the Land Remote Monitoring and Management), a community-driven project that provides a curated list of Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools that could potentially be abused by threat actors. Our mission is to assist security professionals in staying informed about these tools and their potential for misuse, providing the community a catalog of these tools which can be used for threat hunting, detection and prevention policy creations.

## üåü Key Features

- A comprehensive collection of RMM tools, that have historically been abused by threat actors
- Structured YAML files that describe key details of each RMM tool, including:
  - Tool name and description
  - Author and creation/modification dates
  - Technical details (website, PE metadata, privileges required, etc.)
  - Supported operating systems and capabilities
  - Known vulnerabilities
  - Installation paths
  - Artifacts left on disk, in event logs, registry, or network
  - Detection methods (including Sigma rules)
  - References and acknowledgements
- Integrates with Sigma to provide detection rules for RMM tools

## üöÄ Getting Started

To begin working with LOLRMM, you can:

1. Check out the [LOLRMM website](https://lolrmm.io/) for browsing the catalog.
2. Clone the repository to explore the YAML files directly.
3. Use our API to access the data programmatically in JSON or CSV format.

### API Usage Example

To fetch the complete list of RMM tools in JSON format, you can use the following curl command:

```bash
curl https://lolrmm.com/api/rmm_tools.json
```

This will return a JSON array containing detailed information about all cataloged RMM tools.

For CSV format, simply change the extension to `.csv`:

```bash
curl https://lolrmm.com/api/rmm_tools.csv
```

These APIs provide an easy way to integrate LOLRMM data into your threat hunting, detection, and prevention workflows.

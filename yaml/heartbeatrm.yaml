Name: HeartbeatRM
Category: 'RMM'
Description: HeartbeatRM is a remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool that has been observed being leveraged in social engineering campaigns, including invitation-themed and Social Security–related phishing lures, to establish unauthorised remote access on victim endpoints prior to the deployment of ScreenConnect. The tool installs as a Windows service and serves as an initial access mechanism and staging point for secondary RMM deployment. Note - Specific binary names and paths reported in threat intelligence could not be independently verified via VirusTotal or official documentation.

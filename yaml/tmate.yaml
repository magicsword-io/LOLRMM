Name: tmate
Category: 'RMM'
Description: tmate is an open-source terminal sharing tool for Linux and Unix-like systems, built on tmux. It enables instant terminal sharing over SSH, allowing remote terminal access and collaboration. The tool creates a unique session that can be shared with others for remote access, making it a legitimate tool for system administration but also potentially useful for unauthorized remote access.
